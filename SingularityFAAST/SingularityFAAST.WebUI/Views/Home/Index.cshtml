The Florida Alliance for Assistive Services and Technology Inc, Florida's Assistive Technology Program for Floridians with Disabilities, 
is dedicated to increasing access to and acquisition of assistive technology (AT) devices and services for Floridians of all ages and

-technology demonstrations.  FAAST works to accomplish our mission through The New Horizon Loan Program, FAAST's Alternative Financing Program,
